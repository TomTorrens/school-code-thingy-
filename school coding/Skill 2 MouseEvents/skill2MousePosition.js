// Values that will not change during the program should be declared at the start of the program by using the the keyword 'const'.
// It is good practice to use  for constants
// The size of the canvas will not change, these should be declared as constants. WIDTH has been done for you.
// Declare a const for height on line 16.
const WIDTH = 500
const HEIGHT = 500

// Events: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp
// All events you could listen for: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp
// The format for an event listener is: element.addEventListener(<which event to listen for>, <what to do with the event>);
// We are listening for the 'mousemove' event in the HTML window element. When the mouse moves we want to call the mouseMoved function.
// Uncomment the line below
window.addEventListener('mousemove', mouseMovedFunction)

function mouseMovedFunction(mouseEvent){
	// When a mousemove event happens the event gets passed to this function.
	// All of the information about the event is stored in a special variable "mouseEvent"
	// You can get a lot of information about the event. Have a look at https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_mouseevent.asp for a full list of info in a mouse event
	// Here we are interested in the offsetX and offsetY properties. These tell us where on the canvas the mouse is
	// Uncomment the next five lines, fix line 47. Check out the log as you move the mouse:
	var mouseX
	var mouseY
	mouseX = mouseEvent.offsetX; // the offsetX property is the x position on the canvas
    mouseY = mouseEvent.offsetY; // the offsetY property is the y position on the canvas
	console.log("mouseX, mouseY",mouseX, mouseY)
	
	// Draw different coloured dots when the mouse is moved. Fix them up one at a time...
	// The x value goes along the width of the canvas, the y value goes along the height
	ctx.fillStyle = "cyan"
	// Use the mouseX and mouseY to draw a dot where the mouse pointer is
    ctx.fillRect(mouseX, mouseY, 6, 6)
	
	ctx.fillStyle = "darkblue"
	// Use the mouseX and mouseY to draw a dot reflected horizontally across the centerline
    ctx.fillRect(WIDTH-mouseX, mouseY, 6, 6)
	
	ctx.fillStyle = "blue"
	// Use the mouseX and mouseY to draw a dot reflected vertically across the centerline
    ctx.fillRect(mouseX, HEIGHT-mouseY, 6, 6)	
	
	ctx.fillStyle = "purple"
	// Use the mouseX and mouseY to draw a dot reflected across the centerpoint
    ctx.fillRect(WIDTH-mouseX, HEIGHT-mouseY, 6, 6)	

	ctx.fillStyle = "purple"
	// Use the mouseX and mouseY to draw a dot reflected across a diagonal - see the image in the doc
    ctx.fillRect(mouseY, mouseX, 6, 6)	

	ctx.fillStyle = "yellow"
	// Use the mouseX and mouseY to draw a dot reflected across a diagonal - see the image in the doc
    ctx.fillRect(WIDTH-mouseY, mouseX, 6, 6)
